### 12. **File I/O in C++**

File I/O (Input/Output) in C++ is used to read from and write to files. The C++ standard library provides file streams for handling file operations.

#### 1. **File Streams**

C++ provides three classes for file handling:

- **`ifstream`**: Stream class to read from files (input file stream).
- **`ofstream`**: Stream class to write to files (output file stream).
- **`fstream`**: Stream class to both read from and write to files.

These classes are defined in the `<fstream>` header.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create an instance of ofstream to write to a file
    ofstream outFile("example.txt");
    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << "Hello, file!" << endl;
        outFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for writing" << endl;
    }

    // Create an instance of ifstream to read from a file
    ifstream inFile("example.txt");
    if (inFile.is_open()) {
        string line;
        while (getline(inFile, line)) {
            cout << line << endl;
        }
        inFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for reading" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Reading from and Writing to Files**

To read from and write to files, you use `ifstream` for reading and `ofstream` for writing. You can also use `fstream` for both reading and writing.

**Writing to a File:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outFile("output.txt");
    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << "This is a line." << endl;
        outFile << "This is another line." << endl;
        outFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for writing" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Reading from a File:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("output.txt");
    if (inFile.is_open()) {
        string line;
        while (getline(inFile, line)) {
            cout << line << endl;
        }
        inFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for reading" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. **File Modes and Operations**

When opening a file, you can specify the mode in which the file should be opened. The following are common file modes:

- **`ios::in`**: Open for input operations.
- **`ios::out`**: Open for output operations.
- **`ios::binary`**: Open in binary mode.
- **`ios::ate`**: Set the initial position at the end of the file.
- **`ios::app`**: All output operations are performed at the end of the file.
- **`ios::trunc`**: If the file already exists, its content is discarded.

You can combine these modes using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    fstream file;
    // Open a file in read and write mode
    file.open("file.txt", ios::in | ios::out | ios::app);
    if (file.is_open()) {
        file << "Adding a line to the file." << endl;
        file.seekg(0); // Move the read pointer to the beginning of the file
        string line;
        while (getline(file, line)) {
            cout << line << endl;
        }
        file.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open file" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Summary

- **File Streams**: Use `ifstream` for reading, `ofstream` for writing, and `fstream` for both.
- **Reading and Writing**: Use stream objects and their member functions like `open()`, `close()`, `<<`, and `>>`.
- **File Modes**: Combine modes to control file operations (e.g., `ios::in | ios::out`).

### Practice Problems

1. **Basic File I/O**
   - Write a program that creates a text file, writes some text to it, and then reads the content back and displays it.

2. **File Copy**
   - Write a program that copies the content of one file to another.

3. **Student Record System**
   - Create a program that stores student records (name, age, grade) in a file and allows the user to add, read, and delete records.

4. **Binary File I/O**
   - Write a program that writes and reads an array of integers to/from a binary file.

5. **Log File**
   - Create a program that logs messages to a file. Each log entry should include a timestamp.
