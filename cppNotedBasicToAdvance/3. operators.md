### 3. **Operators in C++**

Operators are symbols or characters that perform operations on variables or values. C++ provides a variety of operators, each serving a specific function. These include arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, assignment operators, increment and decrement operators, and the ternary operator.

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
These operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations on numeric values (integers or floating-point numbers).

- **`+`** (Addition): Adds two operands.
  ```cpp
  int sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8
  ```
  
- **`-`** (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
  ```cpp
  int diff = 5 - 3; // diff is 2
  ```

- **`*`** (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
  ```cpp
  int prod = 5 * 3; // prod is 15
  ```

- **`/`** (Division): Divides the numerator by the denominator. If both operands are integers, the result is also an integer, truncating the decimal part.
  ```cpp
  int div = 5 / 3; // div is 1
  ```

- **`%`** (Modulus): Returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.
  ```cpp
  int mod = 5 % 3; // mod is 2
  ```

#### 2. **Relational Operators**
These operators are used to compare two values. They return `true` (1) or `false` (0) based on the result of the comparison.

- **`==`** (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
  ```cpp
  bool isEqual = (5 == 3); // isEqual is false (0)
  ```

- **`!=`** (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
  ```cpp
  bool isNotEqual = (5 != 3); // isNotEqual is true (1)
  ```

- **`<`** (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
  ```cpp
  bool isLessThan = (5 < 3); // isLessThan is false (0)
  ```

- **`>`** (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
  ```cpp
  bool isGreaterThan = (5 > 3); // isGreaterThan is true (1)
  ```

- **`<=`** (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
  ```cpp
  bool isLessEqual = (5 <= 3); // isLessEqual is false (0)
  ```

- **`>=`** (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
  ```cpp
  bool isGreaterEqual = (5 >= 3); // isGreaterEqual is true (1)
  ```

#### 3. **Logical Operators**
These operators are used to perform logical operations, typically with boolean values.

- **`&&`** (Logical AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
  ```cpp
  bool andResult = (true && false); // andResult is false
  ```

- **`||`** (Logical OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
  ```cpp
  bool orResult = (true || false); // orResult is true
  ```

- **`!`** (Logical NOT): Reverses the logical state of its operand.
  ```cpp
  bool notResult = !(true); // notResult is false
  ```

#### 4. **Bitwise Operators**
These operators work on bits and perform bit-level operations. They are mainly used in low-level programming.

- **`&`** (Bitwise AND): Performs a logical AND operation on each bit.
  ```cpp
  int result = 5 & 3; // result is 1 (0101 & 0011 = 0001)
  ```

- **`|`** (Bitwise OR): Performs a logical OR operation on each bit.
  ```cpp
  int result = 5 | 3; // result is 7 (0101 | 0011 = 0111)
  ```

- **`^`** (Bitwise XOR): Performs a logical XOR operation on each bit.
  ```cpp
  int result = 5 ^ 3; // result is 6 (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110)
  ```

- **`~`** (Bitwise NOT): Inverts all the bits of its operand.
  ```cpp
  int result = ~5; // result is -6 (Inverts bits of 0101)
  ```

- **`<<`** (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand.
  ```cpp
  int result = 5 << 1; // result is 10 (0101 << 1 = 1010)
  ```

- **`>>`** (Right Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand.
  ```cpp
  int result = 5 >> 1; // result is 2 (0101 >> 1 = 0010)
  ```

#### 5. **Assignment Operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- **`=`** (Simple assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5; // x is 5
  ```

- **`+=`**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x += 3; // x is now 8
  ```

- **`-=`**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x -= 3; // x is now 2
  ```

- **`*=`**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x *= 3; // x is now 15
  ```

- **`/=`**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x /= 2; // x is now 2
  ```

- **`%=`**: Takes the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x %= 3; // x is now 2
  ```

- **`<<=`**: Left shifts the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x <<= 1; // x is now 10
  ```

- **`>>=`**: Right shifts the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x >>= 1; // x is now 2
  ```

- **`&=`**: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the left operand and the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x &= 3; // x is now 1 (0101 & 0011 = 0001)
  ```

- **`|=`**: Performs a bitwise OR operation between the left operand and the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x |= 3; // x is now 7 (0101 | 0011 = 0111)
  ```

- **`^=`**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the left operand and the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  x ^= 3; // x is now 6 (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110)
  ```

#### 6. **Increment and Decrement Operators**
The increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.

- **`++`** (Increment): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  ++x; // x is now 6 (pre-increment)
  x++; // x is now 7 (post-increment)
  ```

- **`--`** (Decrement): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  --x; // x is now 4 (pre-decrement)
  x--; // x is now 3 (post-decrement)
  ```

#### 7. **Ternary Operator (`? :`)**

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement. It takes three operands and evaluates the condition in the middle.

- **Syntax**: 
  ```cpp
  condition ? expr1 : expr2;
  ```

- If the condition is `true`, `expr1` is executed; otherwise, `expr2` is executed.

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = (x > 3) ? 10 : 20; // y is 10 because x > 3
```
