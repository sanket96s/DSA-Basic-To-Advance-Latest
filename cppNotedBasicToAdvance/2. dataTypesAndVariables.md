### 2. **Data Types and Variables**

Understanding data types and variables is fundamental to programming in C++. This section covers primitive data types, `enum` types, type aliasing, type inference, and constants.

#### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data manipulation in C++. Here are the common primitive data types:

1. **int**: Represents integer values.
   ```cpp
   int a = 10;
   ```

2. **char**: Represents single characters. Internally stored as an integer (ASCII value).
   ```cpp
   char c = 'A';
   ```

3. **float**: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
   ```cpp
   float f = 3.14f;
   ```

4. **double**: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
   ```cpp
   double d = 3.141592653589793;
   ```

5. **bool**: Represents Boolean values (`true` or `false`).
   ```cpp
   bool isTrue = true;
   ```

#### `enum` Types

`enum` (enumeration) is a user-defined data type consisting of a set of named integral constants. It improves code readability by allowing meaningful names for sets of related values.

**Example:**
```cpp
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };

Color c = RED;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `enum Color` defines an enumeration with three named constants: `RED`, `GREEN`, and `BLUE`.
  - `Color c = RED;` assigns the `RED` constant to the variable `c`.

#### `typedef` and Type Aliasing

`typedef` and `using` (introduced in C++11) are used to create type aliases, which can simplify code and improve readability.

**Using `typedef`:**
```cpp
typedef unsigned long ulong;

ulong largeNumber = 1000000;
```

**Using `using` (C++11 and later):**
```cpp
using ulong = unsigned long;

ulong largeNumber = 1000000;
```

#### `auto` Keyword for Type Inference

The `auto` keyword enables type inference, allowing the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer.

**Example:**
```cpp
auto x = 10; // int
auto y = 3.14; // double
auto z = "Hello"; // const char*
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `auto x = 10;` deduces `x` as `int`.
  - `auto y = 3.14;` deduces `y` as `double`.
  - `auto z = "Hello";` deduces `z` as `const char*`.

#### Constants (`const`, `constexpr`)

Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed after initialization. C++ provides `const` and `constexpr` for defining constants.

- **`const`**: Defines a constant value that cannot be modified.
  ```cpp
  const int maxValue = 100;
  ```

- **`constexpr`**: Introduced in C++11, ensures that the value is a compile-time constant. It is used for constant expressions that can be evaluated at compile time.
  ```cpp
  constexpr int maxArraySize = 100;
  ```

**Example:**
```cpp
const double PI = 3.141592653589793;
constexpr int maxSize = 1000;

int main() {
    // Error: Cannot modify a constant variable
    // PI = 3.14;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Summary

- **Primitive data types** include `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, and `bool`.
- **`enum` types** provide a way to define a set of named integral constants.
- **Type aliasing** can be done using `typedef` or `using`.
- The **`auto` keyword** allows for type inference by the compiler.
- **Constants** can be defined using `const` and `constexpr` for values that should not change.
