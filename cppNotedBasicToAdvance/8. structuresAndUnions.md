### 8. **Structures and Unions in C++**

#### 1. **Defining and Using `struct`**

A `struct` in C++ is a user-defined data type that allows grouping variables of different types under a single name. 

**Syntax:**
```cpp
struct StructureName {
    dataType member1;
    dataType member2;
    // Other members
};
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Person {
    string name;
    int age;
    float height;
};

int main() {
    Person person1;
    person1.name = "John";
    person1.age = 25;
    person1.height = 5.9;

    cout << "Name: " << person1.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << person1.age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << person1.height << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Nested Structures**

Nested structures are structures within other structures. This allows creating complex data types by combining multiple structures.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
struct OuterStructure {
    struct InnerStructure {
        dataType member1;
        dataType member2;
    } innerStruct;

    dataType outerMember;
};
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Address {
    string street;
    string city;
    int zipCode;
};

struct Person {
    string name;
    int age;
    Address address; // Nested structure
};

int main() {
    Person person1;
    person1.name = "John";
    person1.age = 25;
    person1.address.street = "123 Main St";
    person1.address.city = "New York";
    person1.address.zipCode = 10001;

    cout << "Name: " << person1.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << person1.age << endl;
    cout << "Street: " << person1.address.street << endl;
    cout << "City: " << person1.address.city << endl;
    cout << "ZIP Code: " << person1.address.zipCode << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. **Union Basics**

A `union` is a user-defined data type similar to a `struct` but with a key difference: all members of a union share the same memory location. This means a union can store only one of its members at a time.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
union UnionName {
    dataType member1;
    dataType member2;
    // Other members
};
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

union Data {
    int intValue;
    float floatValue;
    char charValue;
};

int main() {
    Data data;
    data.intValue = 10;
    cout << "Integer: " << data.intValue << endl;

    data.floatValue = 3.14;
    cout << "Float: " << data.floatValue << endl;

    data.charValue = 'A';
    cout << "Char: " << data.charValue << endl;

    // Note: Only the last assigned member is valid.
    cout << "Integer after changing to char: " << data.intValue << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

- **Struct:**
  - **Advantages:** 
    - Can hold multiple data types.
    - Each member has its own memory space.
  - **Disadvantages:** 
    - Larger memory footprint compared to a union.

- **Union:**
  - **Advantages:** 
    - Efficient memory usage as all members share the same memory space.
  - **Disadvantages:** 
    - Can only store one value at a time.
    - Potential for data corruption if not handled carefully.

**Use Cases:**

- **Structures:** Used when you need to group related data of different types together, like representing a person, an address, etc.
- **Unions:** Used when you need to store one of many types of data in the same memory location, like handling different data types in a single variable or managing hardware registers.

### Practice Problem 

Here are a few coding problems based on **Structures** and **Unions** in C++:

### 1. **Student Record System using Structures**
Write a C++ program that uses a structure to store and manage student information.
- The structure `Student` should have the following fields:
  - `name` (string)
  - `rollNumber` (int)
  - `marks` (float)
- In the `main` function, create an array of `Student` structures to store the data for multiple students.
- Allow the user to input data for at least three students and display their details.

### 2. **Address Book with Nested Structures**
Write a C++ program that creates a nested structure to represent an address book.
- The structure `Address` should contain:
  - `street` (string)
  - `city` (string)
  - `zipCode` (int)
- The structure `Contact` should contain:
  - `name` (string)
  - `phoneNumber` (string)
  - A nested `Address` structure.
- In the `main` function, input and display the details for at least two contacts.

### 3. **Union to Store Different Data Types**
Write a C++ program using a `union` to store either an integer, float, or character, based on user input.
- Define a `union` called `Data` with:
  - `int intValue`
  - `float floatValue`
  - `char charValue`
- In the `main` function, ask the user to choose the type of value they want to input (integer, float, or character), then input the value and display it.
- Ensure that only the last assigned value is displayed, as union members share the same memory.

### 4. **Union for Memory Optimization**
Write a C++ program that simulates a `union` to store information about a product.
- Create a union `ProductInfo` with the following members:
  - `productId` (int)
  - `productName` (string)
  - `productPrice` (float)
- Only one of these members can be set at a time. In the `main` function, simulate a product entry where the user can input a product's ID, name, or price, and display the corresponding information.
  
### 5. **Employee Management with Structures**
Write a C++ program that manages employee details using structures.
- Create a structure `Employee` with the following fields:
  - `name` (string)
  - `employeeId` (int)
  - `salary` (float)
- In the `main` function, create an array of `Employee` structures and allow the user to input and display data for at least five employees.

### 6. **Structure with Pointer to Union**
Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of a pointer to a union inside a structure.
- Define a structure `Product` with:
  - A `string` for the product name.
  - A `union` called `ProductDetails` containing:
    - `int productCode`
    - `float productWeight`
    - `char productCategory`
- Create a `Product` structure and assign values using the union. Use a pointer to access the union values inside the structure.

These problems will help you practice and reinforce the concepts of structures and unions, their advantages, and proper use cases in real-world applications.
