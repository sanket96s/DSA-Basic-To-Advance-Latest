### 9. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**

#### 1. **Classes and Objects**

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    dataType member1;
    dataType member2;

    void memberFunction() {
        // Function body
    }
};
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person person1;
    person1.name = "John";
    person1.age = 30;
    person1.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Access Specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)**

- **Public:** Members are accessible from outside the class.
- **Private:** Members are accessible only within the class.
- **Protected:** Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
private:
    string name;

public:
    void setName(string n) {
        name = n;
    }

    string getName() {
        return name;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person person;
    person.setName("John");
    cout << "Name: " << person.getName() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. **Constructors and Destructors**

- **Constructor:** A special member function that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. It is used to initialize objects.
- **Destructor:** A special member function that is executed whenever an object of its class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    Person(string n, int a) { // Constructor
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    ~Person() { // Destructor
        cout << "Destructor called for " << name << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person person1("John", 30);
    person1.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 4. **Member Functions**

Member functions are functions that have their definitions or declarations in the class definition.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
public:
    int length;
    int width;

    int getArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect;
    rect.length = 10;
    rect.width = 5;
    cout << "Area: " << rect.getArea() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 5. **Static Members**

Static members of a class are shared by all objects of the class. A static member function can access only static data members.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
public:
    static int count;

    Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
};

int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter obj1, obj2, obj3;
    cout << "Count: " << Counter::getCount() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 6. **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.

- **Single Inheritance:** A derived class with only one base class.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** A derived class with more than one base class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A derived class with a base class, which is also derived from another base class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple classes are derived from a single base class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance:** Combination of two or more types of inheritance.

**Example: Single Inheritance:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.eat();
    dog.bark();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 7. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows functions to work in different ways depending on the object.

- **Function Overloading:** Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Operator Overloading:** Defining a new behavior for an existing operator.
- **Virtual Functions:** Functions that are defined in a base class and can be overridden in derived classes.

**Example: Function Overloading:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void display(int i) {
        cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
    }

    void display(double f) {
        cout << "Float: " << f << endl;
    }

    void display(string s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print obj;
    obj.display(5);
    obj.display(3.14);
    obj.display("Hello");

    return 0;
}
```

**Example: Virtual Functions:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class show function" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class show function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;
    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    basePtr->show();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 8. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

- **Abstract Classes:** A class that cannot be instantiated. It usually contains at least one pure virtual function.
- **Interfaces:** In C++, an interface can be implemented using an abstract class with only pure virtual functions.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class AbstractBase {
public:
    virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Derived : public AbstractBase {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived class display function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### 9. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding**

Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, or class. Data hiding ensures that data is not accessible outside the intended scope.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Encapsulated {
private:
    int data;

public:
    void setData(int value) {
        data = value;
    }

    int getData() {
        return data;
    }
};

int main() {
    Encapsulated obj;
    obj.setData(100);
    cout << "Data: " << obj.getData() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 10. **Friend Functions and Classes**

Friend functions and classes can access private and protected members of another class.

**Example: Friend Function:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    int width;

public:
    Box() : width(0) {}

    friend void setWidth(Box& b, int w);
};

void setWidth(Box& b, int w) {
    b.width = w;
}

int main() {
    Box box;
    setWidth(box, 10);
    cout << "Width of box: " << box.width << endl; // This line will cause a compile-time error because width is private

    return 0;
}
```

**Example: Friend Class:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    int width;

public:
    Box() : width(0) {}

    friend class BoxManipulator;
};

class BoxManipulator {
public:
    void setWidth(Box& b, int w) {
        b.width = w;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box box;
    BoxManipulator manipulator;
    manipulator.setWidth(box, 10);
    cout << "Width of box: " << box.width << endl; // This line will cause a compile-time error because width is private

    return 0;
}
```

### Practice Problem 

Here are 5-6 coding problems based on the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++:

### 1. **Class with Constructor and Destructor**
Write a C++ program that defines a `Book` class. The class should have the following attributes: `title` (string), `author` (string), and `price` (float). 
- Define a constructor to initialize these attributes when an object is created.
- Define a destructor to print a message when an object is destroyed.
- In the `main` function, create a few `Book` objects and display their details.

### 2. **Inheritance - Class Hierarchy**
Write a C++ program to model a `Shape` class with a derived class `Rectangle`. 
- The `Shape` class should have a function `area()`, which is a pure virtual function (making `Shape` an abstract class).
- The `Rectangle` class should implement the `area()` function to calculate the area of a rectangle using the formula: `length * width`.
- In the `main` function, create a `Rectangle` object and display the area.

### 3. **Function Overloading**
Write a C++ program to demonstrate function overloading. 
- Create a `Calculator` class that has multiple `add()` functions:
    - One that takes two integers and returns their sum.
    - One that takes two doubles and returns their sum.
    - One that takes three integers and returns their sum.
- In the `main` function, call these overloaded `add()` functions with different parameter types and number of arguments.

### 4. **Polymorphism - Virtual Functions**
Write a C++ program to demonstrate runtime polymorphism using virtual functions.
- Create a base class `Animal` with a virtual function `sound()`.
- Derive two classes `Dog` and `Cat` from `Animal`, and override the `sound()` function in each derived class.
- In the `main` function, create pointers of type `Animal` that point to objects of `Dog` and `Cat` and call the `sound()` function to demonstrate dynamic binding.

### 5. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding**
Write a C++ program to demonstrate encapsulation.
- Create a class `Account` with private data members `accountNumber` and `balance`. 
- Implement public member functions to:
    - Set and get the account number.
    - Deposit money into the account (increase the balance).
    - Withdraw money from the account (decrease the balance).
- In the `main` function, create an `Account` object and perform deposit and withdrawal operations while ensuring that the data is properly encapsulated.

### 6. **Static Members**
Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of static members.
- Create a class `Employee` with a static member `employeeCount` to track the total number of employees.
- Every time an `Employee` object is created, increment `employeeCount` in the constructor.
- Create a static member function `getEmployeeCount()` to return the total number of employees.
- In the `main` function, create a few `Employee` objects and display the total number of employees.

These problems cover various fundamental concepts of OOP in C++, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and static members.
