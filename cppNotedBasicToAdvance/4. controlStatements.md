### 4. **Control Statements in C++**

Control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They help in making decisions, repeating a set of instructions, and jumping to a specific part of the code.

#### 1. **Conditional Statements**

##### `if` Statement
The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5" << endl;
}
```

##### `if-else` Statement
The `if-else` statement executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 10;
if (x > 15) {
    cout << "x is greater than 15" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "x is not greater than 15" << endl;
}
```

##### `else if` Ladder
The `else if` ladder is used to test multiple conditions.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if both conditions are false
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 10;
if (x > 15) {
    cout << "x is greater than 15" << endl;
} else if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "x is 5 or less" << endl;
}
```

##### `switch-case` Statement
The `switch-case` statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if variable == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if variable == value2
        break;
    // you can have any number of case statements
    default:
        // code to be executed if variable doesn't match any case
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
char grade = 'B';
switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        cout << "Excellent" << endl;
        break;
    case 'B':
        cout << "Good" << endl;
        break;
    case 'C':
        cout << "Average" << endl;
        break;
    case 'D':
        cout << "Below Average" << endl;
        break;
    case 'F':
        cout << "Fail" << endl;
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid grade" << endl;
}
```

#### 2. **Loops**

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

##### `for` Loop
The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a known number of times.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
}
```

##### `while` Loop
The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. The condition is evaluated before the loop body is executed.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    ++i;
}
```

##### `do-while` Loop
The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the loop body is executed. This means the loop will always execute at least once.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int i = 1;
do {
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    ++i;
} while (i <= 5);
```

#### 3. **Jump Statements**

Jump statements are used to transfer control to another part of the program.

##### `break` Statement
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement before it completes its normal execution.

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // exit the loop
    }
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
}
```

##### `continue` Statement
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue; // skip the rest of the loop body for this iteration
    }
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
}
```

##### `goto` Statement
The `goto` statement transfers control to a labeled statement within the same function.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
label:
    // code
goto label;
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 1;

start:
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    ++i;
    if (i <= 5) {
        goto start;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Note:** The use of `goto` is generally discouraged as it can make the code difficult to read and maintain.
