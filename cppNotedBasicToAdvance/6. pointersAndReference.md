### 6. **Pointers and References in C++**

Pointers and references are powerful features in C++ that provide a way to directly manipulate memory and create efficient and flexible programs.

#### 1. **Pointer Basics and Pointer Arithmetic**

**Pointers** are variables that store the memory address of another variable. The type of data that a pointer points to determines the type of pointer.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
type* pointer_name;
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int var = 10;
    int* ptr = &var; // Pointer to an integer, stores the address of var

    cout << "Value of var: " << var << endl;
    cout << "Address of var: " << ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value pointed to by ptr: " << *ptr << endl; // Dereferencing
    return 0;
}
```

**Pointer Arithmetic:**
- **Increment (ptr++)**: Moves the pointer to the next memory location of its type.
- **Decrement (ptr--)**: Moves the pointer to the previous memory location of its type.
- **Addition (ptr + n)**: Moves the pointer `n` locations forward.
- **Subtraction (ptr - n)**: Moves the pointer `n` locations backward.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int* ptr = arr; // Points to the first element of the array

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << "Value at arr[" << i << "]: " << *ptr << endl;
        ptr++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation (`new`, `delete`)**

Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory at runtime using the `new` operator and release it using the `delete` operator.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
type* pointer_name = new type;
delete pointer_name;
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int; // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer
    *ptr = 100;
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    delete ptr; // Release the allocated memory

    int* arr = new int[5]; // Dynamically allocate memory for an array of integers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        arr[i] = i + 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << "arr[" << i << "]: " << arr[i] << endl;
    }
    delete[] arr; // Release the allocated memory for the array
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. **Null Pointers**

A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any object or function. It is typically initialized with the constant `nullptr`.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = nullptr; // Null pointer
    if (ptr == nullptr) {
        cout << "Pointer is null" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 4. **Smart Pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`)**

Smart pointers are classes in the C++ Standard Library that provide automatic and exception-safe memory management.

- **`std::unique_ptr`**: A smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope. No two `unique_ptr` instances can manage the same object.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unique_ptr<int> ptr = make_unique<int>(100);
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- **`std::shared_ptr`**: A smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object through a pointer. Multiple `shared_ptr` instances can manage the same object.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = make_shared<int>(100);
    shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = ptr1; // Shared ownership

    cout << "Value: " << *ptr1 << endl;
    cout << "Use count: " << ptr1.use_count() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- **`std::weak_ptr`**: A smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an object that is managed by `shared_ptr`. It must be converted to `shared_ptr` in order to access the object.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = make_shared<int>(100);
    weak_ptr<int> wptr = ptr1; // Weak reference

    cout << "Value: " << *ptr1 << endl;
    cout << "Use count: " << ptr1.use_count() << endl;

    if (auto sptr = wptr.lock()) { // Convert weak_ptr to shared_ptr
        cout << "Value: " << *sptr << endl;
        cout << "Use count: " << sptr.use_count() << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Pointer is expired" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 5. **References and Reference Variables**

References are aliases for existing variables. They must be initialized when declared and cannot be changed to refer to another variable.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
type& reference_name = variable_name;
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int var = 10;
    int& ref = var; // Reference to var

    cout << "Value of var: " << var << endl;
    cout << "Value of ref: " << ref << endl;

    ref = 20; // Changing the value through the reference
    cout << "New value of var: " << var << endl;
    cout << "New value of ref: " << ref << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

References are commonly used in function parameters to avoid copying large amounts of data and to allow the function to modify the argument.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void increment(int& ref) {
    ref++;
}

int main() {
    int var = 10;
    increment(var);
    cout << "Value of var after increment: " << var << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Practice Problem

### Practice Problem: **Pointers and References**

#### Problem 1: **Pointer Arithmetic with Arrays**
Write a C++ program that uses pointer arithmetic to print the elements of a single-dimensional array.
- Define an array of 10 integers.
- Use a pointer to traverse the array and print the elements.

#### Problem 2: **Dynamic Memory Allocation for 2D Array**
Write a C++ program that dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array (matrix) of integers.
- The program should prompt the user to input the number of rows and columns.
- The program should then input the values for the matrix and print it.
- Finally, the program should free the allocated memory.

#### Problem 3: **Null Pointer Check**
Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of a null pointer.
- Initialize a pointer to `nullptr` and check whether the pointer is null.
- If it is null, print a message saying "Pointer is null", otherwise print the pointer's value.

#### Problem 4: **Smart Pointer with `std::unique_ptr`**
Write a C++ program using `std::unique_ptr` to manage a dynamically allocated integer.
- The program should create a `unique_ptr` that points to an integer, set its value, and then print the value.
- The program should demonstrate that the `unique_ptr` automatically deletes the memory when it goes out of scope.

#### Problem 5: **Smart Pointer with `std::shared_ptr`**
Write a C++ program using `std::shared_ptr` to manage shared ownership of a dynamically allocated object.
- Create a `shared_ptr` that points to an integer.
- Assign the `shared_ptr` to another `shared_ptr` and print the use count.
- Finally, print the value of the integer managed by the `shared_ptr`.

#### Problem 6: **Reference Variable**
Write a C++ program that uses a reference variable to modify the value of an integer.
- Declare an integer and a reference to that integer.
- Modify the integer's value using the reference and print the results.

#### Problem 7: **Function with Reference Parameters**
Write a C++ program that demonstrates passing a reference to a function.
- Create a function `doubleValue` that takes an integer reference as a parameter and doubles its value.
- In the `main` function, pass a variable to the `doubleValue` function and print the result.
